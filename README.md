# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch
Machine Learning is the ability thorugh which computers can learn about different things without being explicitly programmed.

There are three major kinds of machine learning techniques:

1. #### Supervised Learning: 
In this, we provide labels for our data. This label is the result that a computer tries to predict for that data. <br>
Example: Regressision, Classification

2. #### Unsupervised Learning:
In this, we do not provide lables for our data. <br>
Example: Clusterning

3. #### Reniforcemnet Learning:
In this, we do not tell the conputer what the correct result is, but rather reward or penalize it according to how close or far it is to correct output. <br>


In this respository, I will code few alogorithms from scratch to show their mathematical logic. <br>
I will use Python Programming Language for this.
